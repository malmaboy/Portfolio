        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Student of Video Game Development at Universidade Lus√≥fona De Humanidades e Tecnologias.
            Currently developing my skills in Unity and C# programming and also Python, HTML, and CSS</p>

        <p>For my graduation final project,
            I'm developing a project called Alter,
            a first-person puzzle game where you play as Layla,
            a girl with a polymorphic body.</p>

        <p>I am interested in developing entertainment games, improving my skills,
            and better understanding the mechanisms behind the creation of video games.</p>
